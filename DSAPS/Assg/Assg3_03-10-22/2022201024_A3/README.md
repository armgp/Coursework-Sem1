#M22CS1.304 Data Structures and Algorithms for Problem Solving#
#Assignment 3#

##Q1. Spell Checker##
	#Input Format#
		First line will contain two space separated integers n, q which
		represents the number of words in the dictionary and the number of
		queries to be processed respectively.
		
		Next n lines will contain a single string s which represents a word in
		the dictionary.
		
		Next q lines will contain two space separated values, First one will
		be an integer ai and second will be a string ti.
		
		ai = 1 means Spell Check operation needs to be done on ti.
		ai = 2 means Autcomplete operation needs to be done on ti.
		ai = 3 means Autocorrect operation needs to be done on ti.
	
##Q2. External Sorting##
	#Input Format#
		./a.out ./data/input.txt ./data/output.txt
		
		Number of integers in a temporary file can be specified in the code.
		Just change the TEMPSIZE value at line 11
		
##Q3. Puzzle Solver##
	#Input Format#
		The first line will contain two integers r and c. Denoting the number
		of rows and columns respectively.
		Next r lines will contain c characters which will represent the row
		wise data of the grid (characters are space separated).
		Next line will be an integer X. denoting the number of words to be
		searched.
		Next X line will contain a singl
