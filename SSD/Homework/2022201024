1. In social medias when we post contents like photos and videos,
   we are given an option to make the post Public or Private.
   This is a usecase of Public and Private scopes. If our post is public
   any user will be able to see it and like or maybe comment on the post, 
   on the other hand if we make the post private (usually the option can be seen as --only me--)
   , only the user can see the post.
   
2. A privileged method can be found for example, in apps like Notion where a user can
   create some text content and share the content to his friends. The friends will be
   able to read his work, but won't be able to modify the content in any way.
   
3. A static scoped variable can be found in any app that keeps count of something.
   For example snapchat keeps count of all the snaps you have sent, although each 
   snap is sent to different people and also it keeps count of number of snaps you 
   have sent to each person. This can  be acheived using static scoped variables.
